    Placeholder for Phylogenetic Generalized Least Squares (PGLS).

    PGLS is used to perform a regression analysis while accounting for
    phylogenetic relationships among species.

    Args:
        tree: A phylogenetic tree object (e.g., from ete3).
        trait_data: A pandas DataFrame or similar structure containing
                    species as rows (or index) and traits as columns,
                    including the dependent and independent variables.
        model: The evolutionary model to use for constructing the
               phylogenetic covariance matrix (e.g., 'BM' for Brownian Motion,
               'OU' for Ornstein-Uhlenbeck).

    Returns:
        Placeholder: Actual implementation will return regression results.
